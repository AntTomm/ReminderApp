# ReminderApp

**Date Created: December 27th, 2023**

**Purpose:**
The importance of this program is to remind me daily through both email & desktop notifications about a specific, urgent task. Sure, we already have a variety of these types of programs, but this desktop program will alert you at a dedicated time of day on both your computer screen and through your preferred email to get it done. In retrospect, it works on your phone and smartwatch as well, as people often get email notifications on their devices as well.

## Personal Benefit:
I have been using this program for my use since I created it, and I can personally attest to its usability, as my creatine usage (what I am using it for), has increased dramatically from once every couple of days to one teaspoon daily.
